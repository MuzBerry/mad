Step 1: create icon 192 x 192 px in png format and rename it to icon.png
Step 2: add icon in asset folder
Step 3 : add dependencies for icon by visitng pub dev site
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_launcher_icons: "^0.13.1"

flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: "launcher_icon"
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/icon/icon.png"
  min_sdk_android: 21 # android min sdk min:16, default 21

run the "flutter pub get command"
after saving the file run the following command for app bundle
"flutter build appbundle" 

Once you run this command, you will find the generated .aab file in the build/app/outputs/bundle/release/ directory of your Flutter project.
After that run the following command for apk bundle
"flutter build apk" 

Once you run this command, you will find the generated APK file in the build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/ directory of your Flutter project.
Download the apk file in your personnel smart phone and install it.

IT WILL TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO BUILD THE APK AND STUFFS. DONT WORRY ITS NORMAL BUT TO SPEEDUP THE PROCESS, I HAVE PROVIDED APKS HERE FOR YOU
